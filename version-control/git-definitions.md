# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

__Version control__ helps you track the progress of a document. It's __useful__ in software development because it allows you to test code without breaking the original code base, allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same code, and allows you to track the date, time and comment of each change submitted.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

You'd use a __branch__ in a git workflow in order to let several people work on developing different features at the same time. It also allows you to branch off from the master document so if you make a misatke, you can easy delete the branch and go back to the original, untouched doc.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? 

A __commit__ is when you push a change from a branch to the master document. It's sort of like a save. A __good commit message__ should be as specific as possible in describing what was changed or added to the code. 

* What is a merge conflict? 
A __merge conflict__ is when there are more than one change to the same code.
